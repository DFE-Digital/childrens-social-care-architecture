# Environments

The following environment have been defined for the needs of the service during Alpha.

__Note:__ since Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is being used, environments can be spun up and torn down as needs change.

## Prototype

__URL__: [Prototype Environment]

This environment is used for rapid user feedback loops on high-fidelity clickable prototype.

## Development

__URL__: [Development Environment]

This environment lays the foundations for the next phase in pulling requirements, via user stories, from the User Research, Service Design and Interaction Design streams.

It will produce a steel thread, akin to bridge building, of features for the Beta to begin with.

## Demonstration

__URL__: TBD

This environment is yet to be built, and is envisaged as an environment to showcase code promoted Development, whilst being more stable to allow for user interactions.
