# 005. Monolith First

Date: 2020-11-11

## Status

Approved

## Context

The CSC Placement service is taking an [Evolutionary Architecture] approach.

## Decision

Since we are in a highly uncertain phase of the Service, and we want to optimise around developer productivity and feature prototyping, the adoption of a [Monolith First] architecture is considered best.

Although Martin Fowler uses this as a precursor for a [Microservice Architecture], it is not definite here regarding a transition to Microservices, but rather a reasonable step before deciding furture architural quanta.

## Consequences

A successfully delivered Service will be rearchitected further down the line, but this will be based on real world data and feedback loops, allowing less costly optimisation at that deferred date.

It can be seen as an application of the [Last Responsible Moment] principle from [Lean].
